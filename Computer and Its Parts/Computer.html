            <p> Introduction of Computer: </p>
            <p> A computer is an electronic device with many attachments. These attachments are either necessary or
                enhance
                a
                computer's performance. These are mainly external components of computers. These parts you can see and
                touch

                learning
                about how to use computers, you will need to be able to identify the main parts that make up a computer.
